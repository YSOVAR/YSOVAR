This the the collection of python moduls that we (Katja and Moritz) use for our
analysis of the YSOVAR data of those two clusters we are currently working on.
While we attempt to write things general and applicable to more datasets, in 
some cases it's still very specific to our two clusters. So, don't be surprised
if it does not work out-of-the-box for you, but feel free to try.

You can find documentation at https://pysovar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

If you use it, feel free to open issues on github or fork it.
