Distances on the sky
====================

Methods in here are required as helper functions for cross-matching sources by position.
Different algorithms with different numerical stability are implemented, but usually
you should not need to call this directly. See the source code of 
:func:`ysovar_atlas.dict_from_csv` for an example how how this works.
